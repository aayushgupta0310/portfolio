        <h2>
          I'm a frontend enthusiast, developer, and technical expert. I've been
          privileged to harness the power of tools like React, TypeScript, and
          Next.js across a span of 3 years in the field. During this time, I've
          consistently optimized user experiences and crafted seamless web
          interfaces. I'm currently deepening my expertise in frontend
          technologies and am passionate about contributing to innovative
          projects that challenge the status quo.
